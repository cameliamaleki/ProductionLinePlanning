Some Point about project which I Uploaded:
1.	Project is developed in MVC framework. (model, view, controller)
•	The Model component corresponds to all the data-related logic that the user works with. This can represent either the data that is being transferred between the View and Controller components
•	The View component is used for all the UI logic of the application.
•	Controllers act as an interface between Model and View components to process all the business logic and incoming requests
2.	Backend developed with C# and Linq
3.	Frontend developed with JavaScript, JQuery, HTML, CSS
4.	For database I used Microsoft SQL Server
